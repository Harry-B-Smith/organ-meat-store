Ecommerce Website using Spring MVC and CRUD Operations

This project was developed to meet the requirements of a case study in my Full Stack Java Developer bootcamp at Per Scholas partnering with TEKsystems.

It needed to be a full stack web appliation using core Java to utilize the Spring MVC framework and Hibernate to connect to the database with JPA and JDBC.

I learned mostly about the Spring MVC framework in this project, as well as, Service layers and DAO layers and the reasons why we use them. 

I had the most fun using Hibernate to get the CRUD operations to work.
