<h3 align="left">Motivation and What Problem This App Solves</h3>
Welcome to my Organ Meat Store readme. For the past 7 years, I'd been residing in Thailand. It was there where I found a love for eating organ meat. When I returned to the US, I found it difficult to find organ meat, so I created this e-commerce web application to bring healthy organ meats to the masses. 

<h3 align="left">Reason for Building the Project</h3>
I built this project to satisfy the end of course final project requirements of a Full Stack Java bootcamp. 

<h3 align="left">What I Learned</h3>
I mainly learned how to build web applications using the Spring MVC framework. 

<h3 align="left">Why This Project Stands Out</h3>
This project stands out because it has a very attractive frontend design, but a lot of the features still need to be connected to the backend. 

<h3 align="left">Technologies Used</h3>
This project is a full stack e-commerce web app with Java on the backend and HTML, CSS, and javascript on the frontend. The app uses the Spring MVC framework and Hibernate (JPA/JDBC) to initialize CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a mySQL database. These technologies were used because it was a requirement of my final project in my bootcamp. 

<h3 align="left">Challenges</h3>
I so often got stuck just trying to connect to the database with Hibernate and Spring, but once I got those working, the rest of the project was easy. I had a lot of problems conneting the backend to the frontend and plan to practice with this more as I develop my skills.
